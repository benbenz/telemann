Tasks to do ...

### Todo

- [ ] https://github.com/bensonruan/Speech-Command 
- [ ] https://github.com/bensonruan/Chrome-Web-Speech-API
- [ ] Locks when skipping: disable the thRender timeout: the rendering will block after few skips ...
      The thRender doesnt solve the issue. It just avoids it in usual use cases where the user is skipping reltively fast
