# TODOs

Tasks to do ...

### Todo

- [ ] https://github.com/bensonruan/Speech-Command 
- [ ] https://github.com/bensonruan/Chrome-Web-Speech-API
- [ ] Locks when skipping: disable the thRender timeout: the rendering will block after few skips ...
      The thRender doesnt solve the issue. It just avoids it in usual use cases where the user is skipping reltively fast
- [ ] Analysis:
  - [ ] Envelope: turn arpegiator off and render audio >> envelope analysis
  - [ ] Preset/OSC+Fitler+Amp:
     - [ ] OSC  >> rule by looking at parameters
     - [ ] FILT >> rule by looking at parameters 
     - [ ] ENV  >> rule by looking at parameters 

- [ ] Issue with Collapsing "model" in Diva: not the case in the VST plugin: Problem with AU parameters parsing ? in pedalboard or JUCE ?
- [ ] Issue with VST Preset Name being offset with SynthMaster ... (not Diva VST ...) No idea why

### In Progress ðŸ•‘

- [ ] Implement PedalBoard VST (v1) handling: https://forum.juce.com/t/midi-program-change-forwarding-for-vst3/47161
      Issue with VST3 and program changes all over the place ...

### Done âœ“
